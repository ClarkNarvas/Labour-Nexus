Labour has a new faction, [Progressive Britain](http://progressonline.org.uk), launched at an online conference at ten o’clock this morning. Its goal is to create new policies for the centre-left, embracing the spirit of New Labour but updating its programme to be relevant to the 2020s, rather than simply copying-and-pasting ideas that worked in the 2000s. And, like most other Labour groups, it also claims that it will help to end factionalism. So who is behind ‘Progressive Britain’ — and what does it mean for Labour’s internal politics?

[Wes Streeting](https://twitter.com/wesstreeting), recently promoted to Shadow Secretary of State for Child Poverty, is the man in the driving seat for this new group. Streeting is on the Blairite wing of the party, backing Jess Phillips in the 2020 leadership election, though he has recently emerged as an important ally to Keir Starmer. He is currently stepping back from politics for medical reasons, but once he returns, he plans to lead Progressive Britain.

Keir Starmer has given his support to Streeting’s new group, speaking at its launch this morning. Anas Sarwar, leader of Scottish Labour, also spoke at the event. Interestingly, though both Starmer and Sarwar are soft left, and each identify as a socialist, the new faction they have backed describes itself as ‘centre-left’ and backs ‘social democracy’.

In organisational terms — unfortunately, this gets a bit complicated — the new faction Progressive Britain is a merger between two existing groups, Progress and Policy Network. Progress was a Labour faction set up in the 1990s to back Tony Blair’s modernisation project, New Labour, and Policy Network is a think tank associated with Peter Mandelson and the ‘Progressive Governance Network’, which was set up in 1999 by Bill Clinton, Tony Blair and the Dutch, German and Italian heads of state at the time. Andrew Adonis is on the board of Policy Network.

In April 2020, Progress established an alliance with [Labour First](https://www.labourfirst.org/), a group linked to Tom Watson and John Spellar, led by contentious NEC member Luke Akehurst. Progressive Britain will maintain this alliance with Labour First, called ‘Labour to Win’.

So what does its launch mean for Labour’s internal politics? Streeting says that he hopes the new organisation will help tackle factionalism, calling Progressive Britain a ‘big tent’, and the launch statement describes their vision as ‘broad-based’. Certainly, it is possible to interpret the soft left Starmer and Sarwar’s enthusiasm for the new group as an early success for a plan to unite the centre-left and soft left against the Tories. There are also flashes of Blue Labour — Jon Cruddas was one of four launch speakers about Labour’s values, and their launch statement talks about how people want to ‘feel proud of the places they live’. Despite its aesthetic emphasis on progressivism, might this new alliance also be looking to court soft Blue Labourites?

On the other hand, Progressive Labour’s stated commitment to opposing factionalism does not extend as far as working with the democratic socialist wing of the party, which they call the ‘hard left’. Patrick Diamond, chair of Policy Network, says that Progressive Britain “are against, the ‘hard’ left” (in the context of a statement that they should focus on more on what they are for than what they are against). Some democratic socialists will no doubt see Starmer’s patronage of the new organisation as evidence that the leader has drifted rightwards away from the soft left proper.

This view might find weight in the absence of soft-left figures like Lisa Nandy and Angela Rayner at Progressive Britain’s launch. If Starmer remains on the soft left, backing Streeting’s new organisation when others do not, will its plan to create a social democratic ‘big tent’ split the soft left?

Factionalism and anti-factionalism aside, the impact that Progressive Britain hopes to have is clear: moving the party’s traditional ‘New Labour’ faction beyond the actual policies of New Labour and towards something fit for the 2020s. “For the last decade the party’s modernising wing has been frozen in time … We live in an utterly different world from the 1990s. Solutions for then are no longer appropriate for today”, explained Patrick Diamond. The word Streeting uses is ‘reinvention’.

He hopes to end the “battle between two competing visions of the past” — a reference to Blairism and Corbynism — by “bringing together some of the best thinking from across the left to develop the fresh ideas we need”, referring to his intentions to unite the centrists, the soft left and perhaps Blue Labour. 

So what will Progressive Britain’s post-Blairism look like? The values articulated in the launch statement are familiar; “progressive  social democracy”, “an open, tolerant and progressive Britain, anchored in the radical centre-left of politics”, “opportunities and security for all”. An interesting new strand is an emphasis on localism, and the idea that change must come from “below” Whitehall. This resonates with Andy Burnham’s recent Guardian article, where he called for Labour to embrace a national vision based on the power of devolution.

All in all, the launch of Progressive Britain should not be ignored. It does not represent a truly radical attempt to forge unity across the Labour Party, like Labour Nexus — setting up a ‘big tent’ amounts to Labour’s centrist wing extending an olive branch to the soft left and certain Blue Labourites, and the commitment to opposing factionalism sits alongside the usual statements about opposing the ‘hard left’. 

However, it may well be a significant moment for the moderates. As captured by the raised eyebrows in response to Andrew Adonis’s ‘Time for Blair’ tweets, there is no desire in Labour to revert back to outdated politics that were modern in the 2000s. This is the first concrete step towards a post-Blairism on the traditional New Labourite wing of the party, and — led by a ‘rising star’ like Wes Streeting and with the backing of both the English and Welsh party leaders — its plan to articulate a fresh vision from the centre does seem plausible. Only time will tell if they succeed.
