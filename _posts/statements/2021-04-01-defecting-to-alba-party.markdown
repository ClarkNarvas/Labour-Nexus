The Labour Party is riddled with factionalism and we see no reason to fix it. Instead, we are defecting to the one party in UK politics with no link to factions or party civil wars. The one political force which is devoted to our values of co-operation and working in good faith. The growing alliance of men and women fighting for the #Supermajority.

<b> That’s right. We are defecting to the Alba Party. </b>

Alex Salmond has decided to put his well-publicised differences with Nicola Sturgeon aside to — as he puts it — “help her” achieve a #Supermajority. How laudable. Indeed, we believe that launching the Alba Party was, in a sense, the ultimate act of anti- factionalism. There is no-one in modern British politics who dislikes petty squabbles, personal vendettas and unfounded conspiracy theories as much as Mr Salmond does. That is why we are proud to announce <b>Alba Nexus, uniting for the #Supermajority.</b>

Alba Nexus aims to “help” Mr Salmond and the Alba Party just as he hopes to “help” Ms Sturgeon and the SNP. We shall be the Alba Party’s very own Alba Party, uniting for the #Supermajority.

Some — most — all — of the Alba Nexus executive are based in England and Wales, but that sort of thing doesn’t seem to bother the Northern Independence Party, so we don’t see why it should bother Alba either.

Our first campaign will be calling for a special conference to elect a new Alba leader who has a better track record on literally anything.
