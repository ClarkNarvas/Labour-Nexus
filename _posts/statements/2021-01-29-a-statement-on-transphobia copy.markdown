Labour has a problem with transphobia. The fact that Dr Heather Peto had to resign the chair of LGBTQ+ Labour today is an alarming sign of just how serious this problem has become, and it must be a call to stronger words and stronger actions — including from the party leadership, whose silence on transphobia in Labour is quickly becoming alarming as well. 

Nexus opposes transphobia in all its forms. This includes transphobia in the guise of debate — Nexus exists to promote co-operative debate in Labour, but we want to be absolutely clear that trans rights are not up for debate. Trans rights are human rights. If that statement is contentious for you, listen to trans voices and educate yourself, or leave.
