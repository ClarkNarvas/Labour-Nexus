Earlier this evening, Labour Nexus messed up, and we announced that a transphobic Labour councillor would be speaking at our rally. We are sorry. This incident was the specific fault of Kerry Stapleton, who only vetted Laurie three weeks before we announced that he would be speaking, before he had outed himself as a transphobe, and did not check his timeline again before linking to his profile.

When we were planning for our rally on 19 June, members of the executive committee asked various Labour elected representatives if they would be interested in speaking at the rally. On 24 May, Kerry Stapleton from Nexus asked Councillor Laurie Burton and Laurie agreed to speak. At the time, Kerry checked through Laurie’s recent twitter timeline and saw no concerning material.

On 10 June, Laurie posted a tweet describing the procedural decision in favour of high-profile transphobe Maya Forstater at an employment tribunal as a “victory for women’s rights” and a “victory for free speech”, invoking two dangerous transphobic tropes. Earlier this evening, we announced that Laurie had agreed to speak at our rally, and we linked to his twitter account, not having checked through it again since Kerry spoke to him on 24 May. The transphobic tweet was then drawn to our attention.

We are incredibly ashamed that, having made a public statement in the past that Labour has a transphobia problem, we failed to be cautious and check again before endorsing a councillor we were not familiar with. Our naivety has led to us contributing to that problem, we had a responsibility to know better, and we are sincerely sorry.

As Labour Nexus has said in the past, trans rights are not up for debate. Trans rights are human rights. If that statement is contentious for you, listen to trans voices and educate yourself, or leave.

Laurie Burton has been reported to the Labour Party, and we sincerely hope that the leadership will defy our low expectations and actually punish him.
