    <h4>Name</h4>
<p>1.1 The name of the organisation in all English is â€˜Labour Nexusâ€™, which may be abbreviated to â€˜Nexusâ€™ in contexts where the meaning is clear.</p>
<h4>Objects</h4>

<p>2.1 The aims of Nexus will be to:</p>

<p>2.1.1 Oppose factionalism and encourage unity, co-operative and constructive debate, and co-operation between the various traditions and groups in the Labour Party;</p>

<p>2.1.2 Provide a safe, welcoming and non-factional space for members of the Labour Party, with a focus on but not limited to young members, to get involved with the wider labour movement and its networks and develop their political awareness and ideas;</p>

<p>2.1.3 Encourage inactive and new members to get involved with the Labour Partyâ€™s networks, and encourage Labour supporters to join the Party and its networks; and</p>

<p>2.1.4 Support the Labour Partyâ€™s electoral campaigns as a parallel campaigning force.</p>

<p>2.2 The organisation shall work to build its influence and relevance in British politics and in the internal politics of the Labour Party so that it is in the strongest possible position to achieve the aims set out in 2.1.</p>

<p>2.3 In support of its objectives in 2.1 and 2.2, the organisation shall have the authority to carry out any lawful activities whatsoever, provided that such activities are also in line with the rules of the organisation.</p>

<h4>NEXUS AND THE LABOUR PARTY</h4>

<p>3.1 â€˜Labour Partyâ€™ means the registered political party in the United Kingdom. In 3.3 and 3.4, it also means the Co-operative Party and socialist societies as defined by the Labour Party.
3.2.1 The organisation is not affiliated to the Labour Party and is not a socialist society as defined by the Labour Party.
3.2.2 The organisation shall operate within the political context of the Labour Party, and shall work to achieve its objectives by working within the existing, and creating new, structures and networks in the Labour Partyâ€™s membership, elected representatives, and activist base. 
3.4 The organisation shall exclusively support the Labour Party at all electoral levels.</p>

<h4>MEMBERSHIP</h4>

<p>4.1 Membership of the organisation is open to any member of the Labour Party who has not been suspended from the Labour Party or suspended from Nexus.</p>

<p>4.2 Membership is at the discretion of the executive committee, and that committee shall have the power, at any time, to expel any person from Nexus or waive the normal requirements for membership. This must be for good reason and the reasoning must be written up and sent to the advisory board for review.</p>

<p>4.2.1 The internal rules of the organisation can allow for other bodies or persons to expel or suspend members of the organisation for good reason.</p>

<p>4.2.2 If in a vote under 4.2 the membership officer votes against expelling a member, it shall go from the executive committee to a joint meeting of the executive committee and the advisory board, where expulsion shall require a simple majority.</p>

<p>4.3 Members may be required to pay a membership fee set by the executive committee.</p>

<p>4.4 There shall be a membership secretary, who shall keep records of members, and to whom additional powers or responsibilities may be delegated by the internal rules of the organisation.</p>

<p>4.5 Members may resign at any time by communicating their resignation in writing or via a digital message to the membership secretary.</p>

<p>4.6 Any member who has not paid a membership fee under 4.3 for twelve months shall be contacted by the membership secretary, who shall determine whether or not that member has resigned from the organisation.</p>

<p>4.7.1 A person who has been deemed to have resigned under 4.5 or 4.6 but considers their membership to continue may appeal to the advisory board, who shall make the final judgement on the matter.</p>

<p>4.7.2 No part of 4.7.1 limits the powers of the executive committee in 4.2.
Equal opportunities</p>

<h4>EQUAL OPPORTUNITIES</h4>
<p>5.1 Nexus shall not discriminate on the basis of any protected characteristic under the Equality Act 2010. The organisation is committed to creating a safe environment for all members. Nexus will always support the emancipation of all marginalised people, and this can override 2.1.4 and 3.1.4</p>

<p>5.2 There shall be an equalities officer, who shall work to ensure that 5.1 is upheld, and to whom additional powers or responsibilities may be delegated by the internal rules of the organisation.</p>

<h4>FINANCES</h4>
<p>6.1 Nexus may hold money and assets. It must only spend money either to meet legal obligations or to pursue its aims under 2.1 and 2.2. Nexus is a non-profit organisation.</p>

<p>6.2 There shall be a treasurer, who shall be the ultimate arbiter of all spending, and who shall maintain accounts for the organisation in accordance with best practice and law.</p>

<p>6.3 At least one member of the advisory board must always have access to any bank accounts of the organisation in addition to the treasurer.</p>

<h4>SOCIAL MEDIA AND COMMUNICATIONS</h4>

<p>7.1 Nexus shall have a brand identity and a presence on social media platforms.</p>

<p>7.2 There shall be a social media and communications officer, who shall create the organisationâ€™s brand identity, manage the organisationâ€™s communications and run the organisationâ€™s social media presence.</p>

<h4>GOVERNANCE</h4>

<p>8.1 There shall be a chair of Nexus, who shall lead the organisation, represent it, and be ultimately responsible for its compliance with the law and its own internal rules.</p>

<p>8.2 There shall be a vice-chair and secretary of Nexus, who shall co-operate with the chair and assist them in their work, who shall lead the organisation when the chair is unable to do so, shall organise meetings of the executive committee, and lead all administrative work within the organisation.</p>

<p>8.3 The membership secretary, equalities officer, treasurer, social media and communications officer, chair, and vice-chair and secretary shall constitute an executive committee, which shall lead the organisation.</p>

<p>8.3.1 Each officer shall be elected in a single transferable vote race using the Dâ€™Hondt quota.</p>

<p>8.3.2. The elections to each office shall be distinct and a person may run for as many offices as she, he or they wishes. If a person is elected to more than one, she, he or they shall choose a single office to hold, and the other offices for which they ran shall be awarded to the candidate who came in second place in the relevant election.</p>

<p>8.4 There shall exist an advisory board, with five seats.</p>

<p>8.4.1 Rhiannon Barron, Jack Bowen, Solomon Cuthbertson, and Jack Thurlow are the founders of Nexus.</p>

<p>8.4.2 At the coming into force of this constitution, the founders shall constitute the advisory board. The founders shall be free to resign from the advisory board if they wish.</p>

<p>8.4.3 Whenever a seat is vacant on the advisory board, including at the coming into force of this constitution, it shall be filled by the existing members co-opting a new member.</p>

<p>8.4.4 In the event that all the members of the advisory board resign at once, the executive committee shall appoint two members of a new advisory board, who shall co-opt three further members.</p>

<p>8.5 No person shall serve on the advisory board and the executive committee at the same time. A person on the advisory board cannot stand for election to an office which would give them a seat on the executive committee.</p>

<p>8.6 The executive committee is the steering committee of the organisation. All powers that exist within the organisation and are not otherwise delegated shall be assumed to lie with the executive committee.</p>

<p>8.7 The advisory board exists to ensure that Nexus stays faithful to its aims under 2.1, the intentions of its founders, and the principles of democratic socialism. It also exists to advise the executive committee and ensure that the organisation is properly governed.</p>

<p>8.8 The executive committee shall meet at least once a month. The vice-chair and secretary will schedule the meetings of the executive committee.</p>

<p>8.9.1 The advisory board shall meet as frequently as its members wish. If it is required to carry out a function under this constitution or any other internal rule of Nexus, it shall organise a meeting within two weeks of being notified that it must do so.</p>

<p>8.9.2 The executive committee and the advisory board shall each carry out actions by members of the committee or board proposing motions and motions being voted on by all those present at the meeting.</p>

<p>8.9.3 The executive committee or the advisory board shall have acted if and only if a motion is supported by more people than oppose it.</p>

<p>8.9.4 Any member of the advisory board or executive committee who has notified the committee or board that they shall not be present at a meeting shall be counted in each vote as though they had voted against any motion. Conversely, anyone who fails to attend a meeting without having notified the committee or board that they will be absent shall be counted as having abstained from all votes.</p>

<p>8.10 The executive committee may make internal rules for the organisation, which shall, where they do not contradict either this constitution or the rules of the Labour Party, have the same force as the constitution. The preamble of any document created under this provision must declare that it was created under provision 8.10 of the constitution.</p>

<p>8.11.1 The advisory board may, by a simple majority vote, call an emergency general meeting (!GM) where the advisory board will make its case and a vote will be held on whether to remove an officer who sits on the executive committee from her, his or their post.</p>

<p>8.11.2 A !GM shall be treated as procedurally equivalent to an AGM.</p>

<p>8.11.3 If an officer is removed from their post at a !GM, an election shall be held for the post at that meeting. Any other by-elections scheduled for the next AGM shall also be held at the !GM.</p>

<p>8.12 If an incumbency falls upon a vacant office, the chair shall be responsible for ensuring that the organisation remains well-governed and in compliance with the law, and may temporarily abrogate internal rules or delegate responsibilities to other persons to facilitate this.</p>

<h4>THE ANNUAL GENERAL MEETING</h4>

<p>9.1 There shall be an Annual General Meeting (AGM) of the organisation.</p>

<p>9.2 A joint meeting of the executive committee and advisory board may make standing orders for the AGM.</p>

<p>9.3 The organisation shall carry out all its relevant responsibilities under the law at this AGM, including approving the accounts.</p>

<p>9.4 The meeting of the persons who later approved this constitution on 14 December was the first AGM of the organisation and the election held then was valid.
9.5 In accordance with any restrictions imposed by the standing orders, the AGM may vote to remove any member of the advisory board.</p>

<h4>Amendment and interpretation</h4>

<p>10.1 By an ordinary motion, the executive committee may amend section 4, 5, 6 or 7, and provisions 8.1 and 8.2, of this constitution or introduce a comparable section defining an area of responsibility and a role, and make minor amendments to other sections if these become necessary to correct errors or resolve contradictions or omissions created by an earlier amendment.</p>

<p>10.2 The advisory board shall interpret the constitution in the ultimate instance. It may delegate this authority to the AGM only.</p>

<p>10.3 Other than as provided for by 10.1, sections 3, 8 and 9 of the constitution may only be amended by a joint vote of the executive committee and the advisory board.
