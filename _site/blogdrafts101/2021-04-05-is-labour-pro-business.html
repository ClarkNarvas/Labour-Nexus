<p>This article is the first in Labour Nexus‚Äô series considering both sides of contentious arguments. These articles will not support one side over the other. Rather, they will operate as an easily accessible, bitesize articulation of the pertinent arguments over contemporary issues. In recent weeks, there has been much debate over <a href="https://www.msn.com/en-gb/money/homeandproperty/keir-starmer-the-labour-party-are-more-than-pro-business/vi-BB1f7Pwr?pfr=1">Keir Starmer‚Äôs ‚Äòpro-business‚Äô stance</a>. Here, the arguments for and against such a stance will be discussed.</p>

<h4 id="pro-business-is-contrary-to-labour-values">Pro-business is contrary to Labour values</h4>

<p>The argument against this pro-business stance is that it runs contrary to the fundamental principles and aims of the Labour Party. Why, it has been asked, should the Labour Party support business when our primary aim is to support workers. This argument finds weight in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keir_Hardie">Keir Hardie‚Äôs</a> articulations at the start of the 20th century. Hardie proclaimed that ‚Äú[t]he worker in the workshop is fettered by the thought that outside his workshop gates there are thousands eager and willing to step into his shoes should he be dismissed in consequence of any attempt to improve his position‚Äù. It is this unequal relationship between employer and employee that inspired Hardie to create a socialist movement. Without respecting this raison d‚Äôetre of the Labour Party, we lose all our principles.</p>

<p>Pro-business is not possible without an anti-worker mentality. The Labour Party should always prioritise the protection of workers rights rather than supporting business. There is great inequality of bargaining power between employers and employees. A contract of employment is often a fixed-form contract, with no room for negotiation. This inability to negotiate places the worker in a poor position.</p>

<p>Firstly, the working hours and rate of remuneration are often set with only the benefits of the employer in mind. The worker is often economically compelled to accept these employer-favoured benefits, effectively meaning that businesses can impose whatever onerous terms they wish. Secondly, <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/4555ae68-75a5-11e6-bf48-b372cdb1043a">there has been a large increase of zero-hour contracts in recent years</a>. In law, those on zero-hours contracts are not considered to be employees, rather they fall into the lesser category of workers. This is because there is no mutuality of obligations between employer and employee when the employer is under no obligation to give the worker hours. This classification as a worker grants fewer statutory employment rights than an employee receives. This combination of inequality of bargaining power, and the growing limitation of statutory employment rights in the context of zero-hours contracts, means that the Labour Party should focus on workers rights rather than appease business.</p>

<p>A real worry coming out of this pro-business stance is that this represents a genuine departure from the radical policies of the past five years. The manifestos in both <a href="https://labour.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/labour-manifesto-2017.pdf">2017</a> and <a href="https://labour.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Real-Change-Labour-Manifesto-2019.pdf">2019</a> had, at the heart of them, the desire to protect the workers (the many) against the interests of businesses (the few). A pro-business stance runs contrary to this. Worse still, there is no evidence that the jeopardising of these principles achieves electability. Not only has Keir Starmer‚Äôs approval rating fallen in recent polls, but the Labour Party is also falling further behind the Tories. Therefore, not only is this pro-business stance contrary to Labour values, its justification in terms of electability is flawed.</p>

<h4 id="being-pro-business-is-good-actually">Being pro-business is good, actually</h4>

<p>A pro-business approach is compatible with Labour values. Those who say it is not misunderstand the rationale behind an advocation for workers rights. We do not (and should not) support workers rights because workers are more important people than business owners. Rather, we support workers rights because big business is powerful. Owing to this power, the only way to ensure a fair bargain is for the state to provide collective rights. It is this desire to pushback against powerful business that the Labour Party should support small business. Small businesses have the same inequality of bargaining power as workers. For example, farmers who supply supermarkets are often subject to exclusivity clauses and rely on state subsidies to make their industry profitable. A small clothes manufacturer who supplies a large chain will also be subject to these onerous terms, often with the possibility of a unilateral change of contract. In this regard, both small-businesses and workers suffer from the same status as they are both ‚Äòdependent contractors‚Äô. This is a term that has been used in arguments for the reform of employment rights. Fundamentally, these small businesses rely on big business to the same extent that workers do. Therefore, we should seek to protect both to the same degree.</p>

<p>The argument that we should prioritise the protection of workers rights over those of small businesses fail to understand that it is not a zero-sum game. We can push for stronger rights for both at the same time. Yes, there may be clashes at times between workers‚Äô rights and those of small businesses. For example, a small business may be struggling financially and wish to pay its staff below minimum wage. However, many of the issues faced by small businesses are caused by their subordination to bigger businesses. If we address the issues faced by small business because of big business, it is less likely that small businesses will take advantage of workers. Fundamentally, most small businesses are bastions of the local community who want to be a force for good. Allowing them to flourish outside of the constraints of the onerous conditions imposed by big business can only be a good thing. Therefore, the Labour Party should push for a pro-small business stance alongside its support for workers‚Äô rights.</p>

<p>In terms of the argument that we are sacrificing Labour values for nothing with a pro-business stance, there are two points to be made. Firstly, small businesses are part of the many. As discussed earlier when considering the ‚Äòdependent contractor‚Äô, the connection between small business and workers is closer than the relationship between small business and big business. Therefore, there is no sacrifice of values at all. Secondly, even if there was a sacrifice, a pro-business stance favours electability. Even if it is not showing in the polls currently, policies such as this will present a mosaic of electability by the time the next General Election rolls around. This mosaic can be the foundation upon which we build a successful election strategy. At the end of the day, we cannot achieve anything if Labour is not in government. It is better to sacrifice some principles than none at all if it means we are able to change the country for the better.</p>
