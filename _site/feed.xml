&lt;p&gt;This article is the first in Labour Nexus’ series considering both sides of contentious arguments. These articles will not support one side over the other. Rather, they will operate as an easily accessible, bitesize articulation of the pertinent arguments over contemporary issues. In recent weeks, there has been much debate over &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.msn.com/en-gb/money/homeandproperty/keir-starmer-the-labour-party-are-more-than-pro-business/vi-BB1f7Pwr?pfr=1&quot;&gt;Keir Starmer’s ‘pro-business’ stance&lt;/a&gt;. Here, the arguments for and against such a stance will be discussed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;pro-business-is-contrary-to-labour-values&quot;&gt;Pro-business is contrary to Labour values&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The argument against this pro-business stance is that it runs contrary to the fundamental principles and aims of the Labour Party. Why, it has been asked, should the Labour Party support business when our primary aim is to support workers. This argument finds weight in &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keir_Hardie&quot;&gt;Keir Hardie’s&lt;/a&gt; articulations at the start of the 20th century. Hardie proclaimed that “[t]he worker in the workshop is fettered by the thought that outside his workshop gates there are thousands eager and willing to step into his shoes should he be dismissed in consequence of any attempt to improve his position”. It is this unequal relationship between employer and employee that inspired Hardie to create a socialist movement. Without respecting this raison d’etre of the Labour Party, we lose all our principles.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;image&quot;&gt;

    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pro-business is not possible without an anti-worker mentality. The Labour Party should always prioritise the protection of workers rights rather than supporting business. There is great inequality of bargaining power between employers and employees. A contract of employment is often a fixed-form contract, with no room for negotiation. This inability to negotiate places the worker in a poor position.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Firstly, the working hours and rate of remuneration are often set with only the benefits of the employer in mind. The worker is often economically compelled to accept these employer-favoured benefits, effectively meaning that businesses can impose whatever onerous terms they wish. Secondly, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ft.com/content/4555ae68-75a5-11e6-bf48-b372cdb1043a&quot;&gt;there has been a large increase of zero-hour contracts in recent years&lt;/a&gt;. In law, those on zero-hours contracts are not considered to be employees, rather they fall into the lesser category of workers. This is because there is no mutuality of obligations between employer and employee when the employer is under no obligation to give the worker hours. This classification as a worker grants fewer statutory employment rights than an employee receives. This combination of inequality of bargaining power, and the growing limitation of statutory employment rights in the context of zero-hours contracts, means that the Labour Party should focus on workers rights rather than appease business.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A real worry coming out of this pro-business stance is that this represents a genuine departure from the radical policies of the past five years. The manifestos in both &lt;a href=&quot;https://labour.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/labour-manifesto-2017.pdf&quot;&gt;2017&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://labour.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Real-Change-Labour-Manifesto-2019.pdf&quot;&gt;2019&lt;/a&gt; had, at the heart of them, the desire to protect the workers (the many) against the interests of businesses (the few). A pro-business stance runs contrary to this. Worse still, there is no evidence that the jeopardising of these principles achieves electability. Not only has Keir Starmer’s approval rating fallen in recent polls, but the Labour Party is also falling further behind the Tories. Therefore, not only is this pro-business stance contrary to Labour values, its justification in terms of electability is flawed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;being-pro-business-is-good-actually&quot;&gt;Being pro-business is good, actually&lt;/h4&gt;

    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A pro-business approach is compatible with Labour values. Those who say it is not misunderstand the rationale behind an advocation for workers rights. We do not (and should not) support workers rights because workers are more important people than business owners. Rather, we support workers rights because big business is powerful. Owing to this power, the only way to ensure a fair bargain is for the state to provide collective rights. It is this desire to pushback against powerful business that the Labour Party should support small business. Small businesses have the same inequality of bargaining power as workers. For example, farmers who supply supermarkets are often subject to exclusivity clauses and rely on state subsidies to make their industry profitable. A small clothes manufacturer who supplies a large chain will also be subject to these onerous terms, often with the possibility of a unilateral change of contract. In this regard, both small-businesses and workers suffer from the same status as they are both ‘dependent contractors’. This is a term that has been used in arguments for the reform of employment rights. Fundamentally, these small businesses rely on big business to the same extent that workers do. Therefore, we should seek to protect both to the same degree.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The argument that we should prioritise the protection of workers rights over those of small businesses fail to understand that it is not a zero-sum game. We can push for stronger rights for both at the same time. Yes, there may be clashes at times between workers’ rights and those of small businesses. For example, a small business may be struggling financially and wish to pay its staff below minimum wage. However, many of the issues faced by small businesses are caused by their subordination to bigger businesses. If we address the issues faced by small business because of big business, it is less likely that small businesses will take advantage of workers. Fundamentally, most small businesses are bastions of the local community who want to be a force for good. Allowing them to flourish outside of the constraints of the onerous conditions imposed by big business can only be a good thing. Therefore, the Labour Party should push for a pro-small business stance alongside its support for workers’ rights.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In terms of the argument that we are sacrificing Labour values for nothing with a pro-business stance, there are two points to be made. Firstly, small businesses are part of the many. As discussed earlier when considering the ‘dependent contractor’, the connection between small business and workers is closer than the relationship between small business and big business. Therefore, there is no sacrifice of values at all. Secondly, even if there was a sacrifice, a pro-business stance favours electability. Even if it is not showing in the polls currently, policies such as this will present a mosaic of electability by the time the next General Election rolls around. This mosaic can be the foundation upon which we build a successful election strategy. At the end of the day, we cannot achieve anything if Labour is not in government. It is better to sacrifice some principles than none at all if it means we are able to change the country for the better.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Conal Land</name></author><category term="Issues" /><summary type="html">A skyscraper in London | Credit Pixabay</summary><media:thumbnail xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" url="http://localhost:4000/images/stock/sky-scraper.jpg" /><media:content medium="image" url="http://localhost:4000/images/stock/sky-scraper.jpg" xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" /></entry><entry><title type="html">What barriers do young people feel there are to getting involved with Young Labour?</title><link href="http://localhost:4000/blogs/2021/04/02/barriers-to-involvement-young-people.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="What barriers do young people feel there are to getting involved with Young Labour?" /><published>2021-04-02T01:00:53+01:00</published><updated>2021-04-02T01:00:53+01:00</updated><id>http://localhost:4000/blogs/2021/04/02/barriers-to-involvement-young-people</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4000/blogs/2021/04/02/barriers-to-involvement-young-people.html">&lt;div class=&quot;image&quot;&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In March 2021, Labour Nexus held a workshop with Young Labour members titled &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/kw_stapleton_/status/1367916364946636802?s=20&quot;&gt;“How Can We Get Our Friends More Involved Despite Our Party’s Internal Culture”&lt;/a&gt;, where we discussed why Labour-supporting young people, including Young Labour members who are not very active in the party and its networks, do not get more involved.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The young people at our workshop identified the following issues with Young Labour that they felt were barriers to themselves or their friends getting more involved. We have typed them up to create this resource, which you are free to use and share if you credit us.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Endless feuds — particularly local ones.&lt;/b&gt; Our workshop agreed that, separately to large-scale factional conflict, many activists had long-term personal grudges and rivalries with other activists, often based in past events. They felt this was a particular problem in CLPs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Antisemitism.&lt;/b&gt; Antisemitism in Labour, which everyone agreed continues to be a problem, was discussed as a barrier for Jewish people and for other potential members who did not wish to be associated with an antisemitic organisation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Bland leadership.&lt;/b&gt; The young people at our workshop said that a barrier to getting their friends involved was that their friends had no idea what Keir Starmer stood for and saw him as “bland”, and as “uninspiring” relative to Jeremy Corbyn. One person also brought up the shadow cabinet and felt they had been too “quiet.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Corbyn “backstab”.&lt;/b&gt; Two people mentioned that their friends had said they were unwilling to get involved with Young Labour because Jeremy Corbyn had been “backstabbed” by Keir Starmer when he withdrew the whip in October 2020.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Supporting Labour — which bit?&lt;/b&gt; One person pointed out that while “supporting the Tories” had a clear meaning, “supporting Labour” was likely to elicit the question “which bit of Labour?” No-one was sure what common values or policies united the various factions in the party and they agreed that made them feel that “supporting Labour” was vague.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Time-consuming.&lt;/b&gt; Being an active Young Labour member was perceived as time-consuming and potentially incompatible with studying for exams or working full time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Being involved requires politics knowledge.&lt;/b&gt; It was suggested that people might assume that to be an active member of Young Labour they had to be “politics nerds” with extensive knowledge and awareness of UK politics or Labour’s factions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Internal debates too economic-focused.&lt;/b&gt; One person said that they felt debates within Labour and the main points of disagreement between factions all focused on economics, whereas Tories and Lib Dems were more interested in debating social policy. Debates about social policy, they said, were more accessible than debates about economic policy, because the latter required technical knowledge about economics.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Policies not known.&lt;/b&gt; There was a shared perception that no-one knew any Labour policies, which made it hard to campaign for the party or be passionate about it in government. Only one person in the group, the discussion facilitator, could name a Labour policy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Twitter, WhatsApp, TikTok.&lt;/b&gt; The group felt that being properly involved in Young Labour required using either Twitter, WhatsApp or what they called “cringe political TikTok”, which meant that encouraging someone to get involved meant persuading them to use one of those platforms.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Kerry Stapleton</name></author><category term="Blogs" /><summary type="html">A young girl and two women at a Labour Party rally in GE2019 | Credit @jeremycorbyn</summary><media:thumbnail xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" url="http://localhost:4000/images/stock/young-people.jpeg" /><media:content medium="image" url="http://localhost:4000/images/stock/young-people.jpeg" xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" /></entry><entry><title type="html">Introducing Alba Nexus</title><link href="http://localhost:4000/announcements/2021/04/01/defecting-to-alba-party.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Introducing Alba Nexus" /><published>2021-04-01T01:00:53+01:00</published><updated>2021-04-01T01:00:53+01:00</updated><id>http://localhost:4000/announcements/2021/04/01/defecting-to-alba-party</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4000/announcements/2021/04/01/defecting-to-alba-party.html">&lt;p&gt;…..xczczxc&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Labour Party is riddled with factionalism and we see no reason to fix it. Instead, we are defecting to the one party in UK politics with no link to factions or party civil wars. The one political force which is devoted to our values of co-operation and working in good faith. The growing alliance of men and women fighting for the #Supermajority.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt; That’s right. We are defecting to the Alba Party. &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Alex Salmond has decided to put his well-publicised differences with Nicola Sturgeon aside to — as he puts it — “help her” achieve a #Supermajority. How laudable. Indeed, we believe that launching the Alba Party was, in a sense, the ultimate act of anti- factionalism. There is no-one in modern British politics who dislikes petty squabbles, personal vendettas and unfounded conspiracy theories as much as Mr Salmond does. That is why we are proud to announce &lt;b&gt;Alba Nexus, uniting for the #Supermajority.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Alba Nexus aims to “help” Mr Salmond and the Alba Party just as he hopes to “help” Ms Sturgeon and the SNP. We shall be the Alba Party’s very own Alba Party, uniting for the #Supermajority.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some — most — all — of the Alba Nexus executive are based in England and Wales, but that sort of thing doesn’t seem to bother the Northern Independence Party, so we don’t see why it should bother Alba either.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our first campaign will be calling for a special conference to elect a new Alba leader who has a better track record on literally anything.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Kerry Stapleton - Chair</name></author><category term="Announcements" /><summary type="html">…..xczczxc</summary><media:thumbnail xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" url="http://localhost:4000/images/stock/albanexusthumbnail.png" /><media:content medium="image" url="http://localhost:4000/images/stock/albanexusthumbnail.png" xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" /></entry><entry><title type="html">You have a future, and you are worthy. 🌹 - An inspirational speech by Dawn Butler.</title><link href="http://localhost:4000/video/2021/01/31/you-have-a-future-and-you-are-worthy.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="You have a future, and you are worthy. 🌹 - An inspirational speech by Dawn Butler." /><published>2021-01-31T08:03:53+00:00</published><updated>2021-01-31T08:03:53+00:00</updated><id>http://localhost:4000/video/2021/01/31/you-have-a-future-and-you-are-worthy</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4000/video/2021/01/31/you-have-a-future-and-you-are-worthy.html"></content><author><name>nexuslabour</name></author><category term="Video" /><summary type="html"></summary><media:thumbnail xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" url="http://localhost:4000/images/posts/video/authenticself/thumbnail.png" /><media:content medium="image" url="http://localhost:4000/images/posts/video/authenticself/thumbnail.png" xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" /></entry><entry><title type="html">Ramsay MacDonald - The first Labour government 🌹</title><link href="http://localhost:4000/video/2021/01/26/first-labour-gov.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Ramsay MacDonald - The first Labour government 🌹" /><published>2021-01-26T09:03:53+00:00</published><updated>2021-01-26T09:03:53+00:00</updated><id>http://localhost:4000/video/2021/01/26/first-labour-gov</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4000/video/2021/01/26/first-labour-gov.html"></content><author><name>nexuslabour</name></author><category term="Video" /><summary type="html"></summary><media:thumbnail xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" url="http://localhost:4000/images/posts/video/first-labour-gov/thumbnail.png" /><media:content medium="image" url="http://localhost:4000/images/posts/video/first-labour-gov/thumbnail.png" xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" /></entry><entry><title type="html">A new COVID patient being admitted every thirty seconds.
