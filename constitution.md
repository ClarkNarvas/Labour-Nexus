<h4>Objects</h4>

2.1 The aims of Nexus will be to:

2.1.1 Oppose factionalism and encourage unity, co-operative and constructive debate, and co-operation between the various traditions and groups in the Labour Party;

2.1.2 Provide a safe, welcoming and non-factional space for members of the Labour Party, with a focus on but not limited to young members, to get involved with the wider labour movement and its networks and develop their political awareness and ideas;

2.1.4 Support the Labour Party’s electoral campaigns as a parallel campaigning force.

2.2 The organisation shall work to build its influence and relevance in British politics and in the internal politics of the Labour Party so that it is in the strongest possible position to achieve the aims set out in 2.1.

2.3 In support of its objectives in 2.1 and 2.2, the organisation shall have the authority to carry out any lawful activities whatsoever, provided that such activities are also in line with the rules of the organisation.

<h4>NEXUS AND THE LABOUR PARTY</h4>

<h4>MEMBERSHIP</h4>

4.1 Membership of the organisation is open to any member of the Labour Party who has not been suspended from the Labour Party or suspended from Nexus.

4.2 Membership is at the discretion of the executive committee, and that committee shall have the power, at any time, to expel any person from Nexus or waive the normal requirements for membership. This must be for good reason and the reasoning must be written up and sent to the advisory board for review.

4.2.1 The internal rules of the organisation can allow for other bodies or persons to expel or suspend members of the organisation for good reason.

4.3 Members may be required to pay a membership fee set by the executive committee.

4.4 There shall be a membership secretary, who shall keep records of members, and to whom additional powers or responsibilities may be delegated by the internal rules of the organisation.

4.6 Any member who has not paid a membership fee under 4.3 for twelve months shall be contacted by the membership secretary, who shall determine whether or not that member has resigned from the organisation.

4.7.1 A person who has been deemed to have resigned under 4.5 or 4.6 but considers their membership to continue may appeal to the advisory board, who shall make the final judgement on the matter.

4.7.2 No part of 4.7.1 limits the powers of the executive committee in 4.2.
Equal opportunities

<h4>EQUAL OPPORTUNITIES</h4>
5.1 Nexus shall not discriminate on the basis of any protected characteristic under the Equality Act 2010. The organisation is committed to creating a safe environment for all members. Nexus will always support the emancipation of all marginalised people, and this can override 2.1.4 and 3.1.4

8.4 There shall exist an advisory board, with five seats.

8.4.1 Rhiannon Barron, Jack Bowen, Solomon Cuthbertson, and Jack Thurlow are the founders of Nexus.

8.5 No person shall serve on the advisory board and the executive committee at the same time. A person on the advisory board cannot stand for election to an office which would give them a seat on the executive committee.

8.6 The executive committee is the steering committee of the organisation. All powers that exist within the organisation and are not otherwise delegated shall be assumed to lie with the executive committee.

8.7 The advisory board exists to ensure that Nexus stays faithful to its aims under 2.1, the intentions of its founders, and the principles of democratic socialism. It also exists to advise the executive committee and ensure that the organisation is properly governed.

8.9.4 Any member of the advisory board or executive committee who has notified the committee or board that they shall not be present at a meeting shall be counted in each vote as though they had voted against any motion. Conversely, anyone who fails to attend a meeting without having notified the committee or board that they will be absent shall be counted as having abstained from all votes.

8.10 The executive committee may make internal rules for the organisation, which shall, where they do not contradict either this constitution or the rules of the Labour Party, have the same force as the constitution. The preamble of any document created under this provision must declare that it was created under provision 8.10 of the constitution.
