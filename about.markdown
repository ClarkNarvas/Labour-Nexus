We are a collection of Labour members and trade unionists around the UK that believe real change only happens when we all unite as one party and ditch the factions that have long plagued this movement. 

Despite our divergent views and ideologies, we are all Labour supporters striving towards a common goal. Unity and collaboration is the key to obtaining the Labour government that we all desire, and can only be achieved through open, free discussion and teamwork.

Join Labour Nexus today and find your place among so many others - we cannot do this without you.
